# Project Structure

This project is segmented into 3 main parts:

* `project`: Contains source code and, as a result, the executables. It is further divided into `preliminary`, which contains source code that prepares data for further analysis, and `models`, which contains the machine learning models.

* `data`: All the necessary datasets, as they need be to be properly parsed.

* `results`: Every result this repository produces (e.x. GeoTIFFs)

Other directories:

* `docs`: Documentation.
* `etc`: Contains remaining files/folders (e.x. pre-commit hooks exec)
